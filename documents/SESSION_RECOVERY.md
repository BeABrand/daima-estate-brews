### Turn 1 — Assistant

Investigated the project: TanStack Start app (no `index.html` — `RootShell` in `src/routes/__root.tsx` renders the HTML root). Source `src/styles.css` had:

```
@import "tailwindcss" source(none);   ← line 1
@source "../src";
@import "tw-animate-css";              ← line 3
@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/...Fraunces...Inter...");  ← line 7
```

Root cause: Tailwind v4 expands `@import "tailwindcss"` into ~3700 lines of generated CSS at build, which pushed the Google Fonts `@import` past other rules in the bundled output, violating the spec.

**Fix (branch `fix/css-import-order`):**
- Removed the Google Fonts `@import url(...)` from `src/styles.css`.
- Added `<link rel="preconnect">` (×2) + `<link rel="stylesheet">` for Fraunces+Inter to the `head.links` array in `src/routes/__root.tsx`.
- Verified with `npx vite build --mode development` → clean build, CSS bundle 84.98 kB, no PostCSS errors.

Commit: `47a2da5 fix: move Google Fonts to head links to satisfy CSS @import order`

Created task list for the three tracks; began Task 2 (Lovable removal).

### Turn 2 — Assistant (initial Task 2 attempt — superseded)

Attempted to remove `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config` build dep, rewrote `vite.config.ts` to wire the underlying plugins manually, deleted `.lovable/`, copied `favicon.svg` + `favicon.ico` + `apple-touch-icon.png` from `daima_coffee_payments/public/` into a new `public/` dir.

User rejected the staging step.

### Turn 2 — User correction

> "I AM STILL USING LOVABLE TO BUILD AND DEVELOP THE WEBSITE UI, I MEANT LOVABLE IMAGES AND ICONS, REMOVE THE LARAVEL ICONS AND IMAGES, USE COFFEE SVG AS THE WEBSITE ICON, LOGO AND IMAGE FOR THE ORGANIZATION"

**Saved to memory:** `/home/kimemia/.claude/projects/-var-www-html-contract-james-projects-daima-estate-brews/memory/feedback_lovable_scope.md` — "remove lovable" in this project means VISUAL/BRANDING assets only, never the build tooling.

### Turn 2 — Assistant (corrected Task 2)

- Reverted `vite.config.ts`, `package.json`, `.lovable/project.json` to HEAD.
- Removed `public/favicon.ico` and `public/apple-touch-icon.png` (default Laravel icons from the payments project).
- Kept `public/favicon.svg` only — it's the custom Daima coffee bean SVG (circular, deep coffee bean fill `#3a2a1c`, cream `#f8efe1` ellipse + center crease forming a coffee bean silhouette, cherry-red `#c44a3a` "D" monogram). Palette matches the existing `--bean / --cream / --cherry` OKLCH variables in `styles.css`.
- Wired the SVG as favicon + apple-touch-icon in `__root.tsx` head.
- Updated `SiteHeader.tsx` to use the SVG as the logo mark (replacing the placeholder `<span>D</span>`).
- Updated `SiteFooter.tsx` to lead with the SVG mark next to the wordmark.
- `npm install` to sync lockfile after the temporary uninstall.
- Build verified clean.

### Turn 3 — Assistant (Task 3 — SEO)

Branch `feat/seo-optimization` (from `chore/remove-lovable-apply-daima-theme`). Added comprehensive SEO:

**New files:**
- `src/lib/site-config.ts` — central config: `SITE_URL` (override via `VITE_SITE_URL`, default `https://daimacoffee.com`), `SITE_NAME`, `SITE_TAGLINE`, `SITE_LOCALE`, `SITE_LANG`, `SITE_TWITTER`, `SITE_DESCRIPTION`, `SITE_LOGO_URL`, `SITE_OG_IMAGE`, `SITE_KEYWORDS[]`, plus `absoluteUrl(path)` helper.
- `src/lib/seo.ts` — `buildSeoMeta({path, title, description?, image?, type?, noindex?})` and `buildSeoLinks({path})` produce the standard set: title, description, og:* (title/description/type/url/image/site_name/locale), twitter:* (card/site/title/description/image), plus canonical.
- `public/robots.txt` — `Allow: /`, `Disallow: /api/`, sitemap reference.
- `public/sitemap.xml` — all 6 static routes + 5 blog posts with `<lastmod>` from each post's date.

**Modified routes:**
- `__root.tsx` — global meta (keywords, author, publisher, robots, googlebot, theme-color `#3a2a1c`, format-detection, application-name, apple-mobile-web-app-title), default og:* and twitter:*, `<link rel=canonical>`, `<link rel=sitemap>`, **JSON-LD Organization** (PostalAddress + ContactPoint with email/phone/Swahili+English), **JSON-LD WebSite**.
- `index.tsx`, `about.tsx`, `produce.tsx`, `logistics.tsx`, `contact.tsx` — switched per-route head to `buildSeoMeta` + `buildSeoLinks` so each emits absolute og:image, og:url, canonical.
- `blog.index.tsx` — JSON-LD `Blog` listing with `BlogPosting[]` for all 5 posts, absolute image URLs.
- `blog.$slug.tsx` — kept the existing Article meta but enriched JSON-LD: `mainEntityOfPage`, `dateModified`, `Organization.publisher.logo` ImageObject, `inLanguage`, plus a separate `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD (Home → Journal → article).

Build verified clean (~199 kB router bundle).

### Turn 4 — Assistant

Branch `docs/readme-and-session-resume` (from `feat/seo-optimization` HEAD).

Created `README.md` covering:
- Stack table (TanStack Start, React 19, Tailwind v4, Cloudflare Workers, Lovable build wrapper).
- Getting started commands (`npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, etc.).
- Project structure tree (`src/routes`, `src/components`, `src/lib`, `src/assets`, `public/`, `documents/`).
- Brand & design tokens — OKLCH ↔ hex mapping for `--bean / --cream / --cherry / --leaf` aligned to the favicon SVG. Typography (Fraunces + Inter via `<link>` only, with the warning to NEVER add fonts via `@import` in CSS).
- SEO architecture — `site-config.ts` + `seo.ts`, what every page emits, JSON-LD types per page, static SEO files.
- Deployment — Cloudflare Workers via `wrangler deploy`, `VITE_SITE_URL` env var.
- Working with this repo — branch naming, commit conventions, no-touch list (`main`, `routeTree.gen.ts`, Lovable wrapper).
- Recent change log table referencing all four prior commits + this one.

Refreshed `documents/SESSION_RECOVERY.md` (this file) and `documents/RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to add Turn 4, expand the branch chain, and reflect the README's existence as canonical project orientation.

### Turn 5 — User

Shared 6 screenshots of `daimacoffee.netlify.app` showing a Netlify "Page not found" 404 on production. Netlify deploy showed build succeeded (19 files uploaded, 2m 7s). Deploy file browser revealed all files landing under a `client/` subfolder — no `index.html` anywhere.

### Turn 5 — Assistant

**Root cause (two-part):**
1. Netlify's publish directory was not configured, so it defaulted to `dist/` (the build root). Assets appeared under `client/` in the deploy browser because Vite writes client output to `dist/client/`.
2. More fundamentally, TanStack Start with `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` never emits `index.html`. HTML is generated at request time inside the Cloudflare Worker. Netlify cannot run that Worker, so every URL returns 404 regardless of publish dir.

**Fix (branch `fix/netlify-deployment`):**

`vite.config.ts` — Enabled TanStack Start's built-in pre-renderer:
```ts
prerender: {
  enabled: true,
  crawlLinks: true,
},
```
With `crawlLinks: true`, the build starts a local miniflare server (bundled via `wrangler` in `node_modules`) after the Cloudflare Worker bundle is compiled, crawls all links starting from `/`, renders each route to HTML, and writes the results as static files into `dist/client/`:
- `dist/client/index.html` (home)
- `dist/client/about/index.html`
- `dist/client/produce/index.html`
- `dist/client/logistics/index.html`
- `dist/client/contact/index.html`
- `dist/client/blog/index.html`
- `dist/client/blog/<slug>/index.html` × 5 (discovered by crawling links on the blog index page)

`netlify.toml` — New file telling Netlify exactly how to build and what to serve:
```toml
[build]
  command   = "npm run build"
  publish   = "dist/client"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"

[[redirects]]
  from   = "/*"
  to     = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```
The `/* → /index.html 200` redirect is a safety-net SPA fallback only; all known routes have pre-rendered HTML so Netlify serves them directly without hitting the redirect.

Each branch is **cumulative on the previous**.

## Verification commands

```bash
npm run build                            # confirms pre-render runs after CF Worker bundle
# Look for "Prerendering pages..." in build output
# dist/client/ should contain index.html at root and in each route subfolder
npm run dev                              # dev mode: SSR via miniflare, no prerender step
```

## Open items

- `SITE_URL` defaults to `https://daimacoffee.com`. If the production domain differs, set `VITE_SITE_URL` in the deploy environment — `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` use the literal default and will need updating if the domain changes.
- `SITE_TWITTER = "@daimacoffee"` is a placeholder.
- `Organization` JSON-LD `sameAs: []` is empty — add social profile URLs when available.
- All branches are local; not pushed to origin (per user rules — no autonomous remote ops).
- No PR opened; user has not requested merge/push.
- Netlify project is auto-deployed from GitHub. The fix branch must be merged into the branch Netlify watches (likely `main`) for the changes to take effect on `daimacoffee.netlify.app`.
